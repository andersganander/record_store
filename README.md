## Design

### Imagery
The images used on the REAL Records web site are chosen to re-create the atmosphere of the real store. Nice images of vinyl records and vinyl players. 

### Colours
The colors used on the site are mainly black, white and red. Black is the natural and most common color of a vinyl record and therefore seems like a natural choice. It is used as a background color i the navigation bar and in the footer. The use of red text on white background is a hommage to the the rock singer David Bowie and his album 'Station to Station'.  

### Fonts
The xxx font is used for headings and in the nav bar. It's chosen because of it's resemblence to the font used on the album 'Station to Station'.
