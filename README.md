# REAL Records

Real Records is a web site for the imaginary record store with the same name. The purpose of the site is to give the users information of what they can find in the store and what events that are arranged so that they want to visit the store. Another goal is to build a community for people interested in music, both in the store but also online.

## Design

### Imagery
The images used on the REAL Records web site are chosen to re-create the atmosphere of the real store. Nice images of vinyl records and vinyl players. 

### Colours
The colors used on the site are mainly black, white and red. Black is the natural and most common color of a vinyl record and therefore seems like a natural choice. It is used as a background color i the navigation bar and in the footer. 

### Fonts
The font "DymoFontInvers" is used to create a feeling of a rock/punk attitude and is used for headings and links in the navigation bar.

For the normal text, courier new is used which also create a feeling of D. I. Y. as it reminds of the look of fanzines from the 80's.
